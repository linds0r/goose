MATH VERIFICATION - YTD Spend Calculation

From the June 2025 data, let me extract the YTD totals:

OVERALL (Main business):
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $429,668
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): $59,598  
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $86,211
OVERALL TOTAL = $429,668 + $59,598 + $86,211 = $575,477

AFTERPAY:
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $17,556
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): ($4,486) [negative number]
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $1,229
AFTERPAY TOTAL = $17,556 + (-$4,486) + $1,229 = $14,299

CASH APP:
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $215,402
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): $9,248
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $3,067
CASH APP TOTAL = $215,402 + $9,248 + $3,067 = $227,717

PROTO/BITKEY:
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $100,434
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): $48,432
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $9,000
PROTO/BITKEY TOTAL = $100,434 + $48,432 + $9,000 = $157,866

TBD:
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $69,705
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): $2,450
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $9,063
TBD TOTAL = $69,705 + $2,450 + $9,063 = $81,218

RENEWALS:
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $26,571
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): $0
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $0
RENEWALS TOTAL = $26,571 + $0 + $0 = $26,571

OTHER:
- In-Plan (Actual Spend): $53,910
- Enforcement (Not In-Plan): $3,955
- Special Projects (Not In-Plan): $63,852
OTHER TOTAL = $53,910 + $3,955 + $63,852 = $121,717

GRAND TOTAL CHECK:
$575,477 + $14,299 + $227,717 + $157,866 + $81,218 + $26,571 + $121,717

Wait... this doesn't make sense. The "OVERALL" section appears to be a summary, not an additional business unit.

Let me recalculate by adding up all the individual business units:

TOTAL ACTUAL SPEND YTD = 
Afterpay: $14,299
Cash App: $227,717  
Proto/Bitkey: $157,866
TBD: $81,218
Renewals: $26,571
Other: $121,717

TOTAL = $14,299 + $227,717 + $157,866 + $81,218 + $26,571 + $121,717 = $629,388

But wait, let me check if the "OVERALL" row is actually the sum or if it's separate...

Looking at the flat fee budgets:
- Overall Annual Fee = $1,050,000 (YTD = $525,000)
- Afterpay Annual Fee = $100,000 (YTD = $50,000)  
- Cash App Annual Fee = $300,000 (YTD = $150,000)
- Proto/Bitkey Annual Fee = $300,000 (YTD = $150,000)
- TBD Annual Fee = $300,000 (YTD = $150,000)
- Renewals Annual Fee = $50,000 (YTD = $25,000)
- Other Annual Fee = $0

Sum of individual units: $50,000 + $150,000 + $150,000 + $150,000 + $25,000 + $0 = $525,000

This matches the "OVERALL" flat fee of $525,000, confirming that "OVERALL" is indeed a summary row, not an additional business unit.

CORRECT TOTAL ACTUAL SPEND YTD = $629,388
